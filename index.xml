      <description>Who are you? What is this? I&amp;rsquo;m Iris, and this is my website. Since 2022, I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in Amsterdam and studied at the UvA. My interest are various and include everything from the subject of my studies (ancient history of the Mediterranean and Mesopotamia) to music, art, philosophy and tech. The best way to give you an idea of this site is via a Q&amp;amp;A.&#xA;What will I find here? All sorts of stuff, really.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="who-are-you-what-is-this">Who are you? What is this?</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m Iris, and this is my website. Since 2022, I&rsquo;ve lived in Amsterdam and studied at the UvA. My interest are various and include everything from the subject of my studies (ancient history of the Mediterranean and Mesopotamia) to music, art, philosophy and tech. The best way to give you an idea of this site is via a Q&amp;A.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-i-find-here">What will I find here?</h2>
<p>All sorts of stuff, really. Whatever I&rsquo;m interested in writing or publishing, I&rsquo;ll publish, but I can make no guarantee about a consistent and laser-focused stream of content. You&rsquo;re free to subscribe to the RSS feed and read whatever catches your eye. To give you a vague idea, I&rsquo;m likely to upload my poetry/short stories, reviews of media, s.a. books, films, musical albums, <em><strong>maybe</strong></em> some philosophical ideas, &lsquo;<em>travelogues</em>&rsquo;, memoires and so on.</p>
<h2 id="how-often-will-you-post">How often will you post?</h2>
<p>Whenever I have time ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯</p>
<h2 id="will-you-write-in-languages-other-than-english">Will you write in languages other than English?</h2>
<p>Generally, I&rsquo;d like to write in other languages as well. The website has a multilingual feature, but I doubt I&rsquo;ll have enough content in different languages to justify using it. Currently, I&rsquo;m trying to learn Russian, French, German and (although this one is barely worth consideration atm) Dutch, my studies include Latin, Koine and Akkadian, and I am fluent in Bulgarian besides English. Still, of these I&rsquo;d only feel confident writing in Bulgarian. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll upload some multilingual content, but don&rsquo;t count on it being a constant.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-ziqqurratum">What is a &ldquo;Ziqqurratum&rdquo;</h2>
<p>A kind of <em>pyramidal</em> structure, built by the ancient Mesopotamians on top of which temples were constructed.</p>
<p>If I come up with any other questions, I&rsquo;ll add them here)</p>
<h1 id="technical-information">Technical Information</h1>
<h2 id="how-is-this-side-made">How is this side made?</h2>
<p>ziqqurratum.com has its domain registered by <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-cloudflare-registrar/">Cloudflare</a>, it&rsquo;s hosted on <a href="github.io">github pages</a>, and it&rsquo;s made with <a href="gohugo.io">HUGO</a> and the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-bearcub/">Bear Cub theme</a> (which I&rsquo;ve modded). It has exactly 1 bit of JS, and that&rsquo;s the &ldquo;Quack&rdquo; button in the navbar because I thought it&rsquo;d be amusing.</p>
<h2 id="what-data-do-you-collect">What data do you collect?</h2>
<p>As far as I know, nothing. It&rsquo;s possible github pages collects some kind of annonymized statistical data for site visitors, but I have no knowledge of how to check. For what it&rsquo;s worth, I don&rsquo;t particularly wish to collect any data or serve ads, and if I&rsquo;m ever to monitize this project, I&rsquo;d probably do it with a donation platform like Patreon.</p>
